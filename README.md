# VisualDepictionOfGraphTraversal
Animation from 2022 where I created a repersentation of both BFS and DFS graph traversal.

To see the project, run TextTools.exe. Source code is within the TextTools folder. Program relies heavily on the TextTools library created by my professor for the creation and animation (for lack of a better term, this is all still programming) of ASCII art in the console.
